# Self-driving-car-Lane-detection

This is the first project in the first term of the Self Driving Car Nanodegree course offered by Udacity.

In this project road lanes are detected using image processing and computer vision techniques such as Gaussian filtering, Canny edge detection and Hough transforms. OpenCV, FFmpeg, and Python were used to process the videos.

The Python code, the images and the videos used in this project along with the final outputs are enclosed.
